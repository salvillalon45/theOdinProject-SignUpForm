[The Odin Project: Intermediate HTML and CSS] - Project: Sign Up Form
</h1>

## Intro

-   The goal of this project was to practice what we have been learning in the Intermediate HTML and CSS modules such as Form Creation, CSS styles & custom properties,positioning, and other concepts. We were to create a sign up form based on a design they gave us
-   The project can be found here: https://odin-signupform-sv.netlify.app/. It is hosted by Netlify

## Lessons Learned

-   For this project I decided to pracitce my approach on the plans I make before starting to code
    -   First, I looked at the design file an started thinking of what the HTML elements I will use and what the HTML structure will look like. This part was helpful since I brainstorm what HTML semantic elements I was going to use
    -   Second, once I got the structure done I looked into what CSS styling I will need and classes I will need to create for selectors. This was really helpful since I was able to visualize how I will use CSS grid to layout the elements
    -   Third, then I started applying the CSS properties that will help with laying out the content. Nothing related to font-size nor color, it was all layout
    -   Fourth, I finished by applying the color, font-size, and etc to the elements that need it
-   Also, I noticed that by working one part at a time and writing down my approach on how I was going to do the left part and the right part was really helpful. It helped me slow down and write code that makes sense.

## Achievements

-   I am really proud how I use CSS grid! The website was really well organized. I was also able to easily apply mobile version. This is the first time I am confident that a website came out really good in mobile and desktop version
-   I used CSS selectors instead of having to write more HTML markdown
-   I finally understood how to use relative positioning

## Proud

**In this project, I felt I had a better understanding of all the tools that are available in CSS. I no longer felt I was randomly using CSS properties instead I felt I knw what I was doing!**
